The files in this repo are meant to be used as a starting point for all new OKFN themed websites.
These files consist of all default Bootstrap (v2) files, plus a stylesheet (okfn-common.css) to add the OKFN branding.

These files are also used for non WordPress specific styling in the OKFN WordPress theme. Any changes made to the fles in this repo (gh-pages branch), will automatically be reflected on all websites using the OKFN theme 1.1 and above.
